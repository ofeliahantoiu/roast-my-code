### Optional but Recommended
- **Webcam/Camera** for screenshot capture functionality
- **Speakers/Headphones** for text-to-speech output

## Installation and Running


### Method 1: Clone and Build 

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ourRepository/roast-my-code.git
   cd roast-my-code/src
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd RoastMyCode
   ```

3. **Restore dependencies**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

5. **Run the project**

### Method 2: Visual Studio

1. **Open Visual Studio 2022** (Community edition is free)
2. **Open the solution file**: `RoastMyCode.sln`
3. **Restore NuGet packages** (Visual Studio should do this automatically)
4. **Build the solution** (Ctrl+Shift+B)
5. **Press F5** or click the "Start" button

## Configuration 

### API Keys Setup

The application requires an OpenAI API key for AI services. You need to update the `appsettings.json` file in the project root:

1. **There is an `appsettings.json`** in the `src` directory 
2. **Add our OpenAI API key**:

```json
{
  "OpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "openai-api-key-here",
    "Model": "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  }
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- Replace `openai-api-key-here` with our actual OpenAI API key
- Get our API key from api_key.txt
- The `appsettings.json` file is already in `.gitignore` to protect our API key
- If you encounter any error with the API key please ensure that the key is also present here `src\RoastMyCode\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows\appsettings.json`

### Dependencies

The application uses the following key dependencies:
- **OpenCvSharp4**: For camera capture functionality
- **NAudio**: For audio processing
- **System.Speech**: For text-to-speech
- **AvalonEdit**: For code editing features
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration**: For configuration management

All dependencies are automatically restored when building the project.
