             * - Application is installed and configured
             * 
             * Steps:
             * 1. Launch the application
             * 2. Set window size to 800x600
             * 3. Verify all UI elements are visible and properly arranged
             * 4. Resize to 1920x1080
             * 5. Verify all UI elements adapt to the new size
             * 6. Resize to 1280x720
             * 7. Verify all UI elements adapt to the new size
             * 
             * Expected Results:
             * - All UI elements should be visible at all resolutions
             * - Text should be readable at all resolutions
             * - No UI elements should be cut off or overlapping

             * 4. Verify colors of all major UI components have changed appropriately
             * 5. Switch back to default theme
             * 6. Verify colors return to original values
             *
