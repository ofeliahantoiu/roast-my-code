            /* Test Case: Usability Issue Documentation
             * 
             * This is a documentation-style test that outlines the usability testing process
             * and documents findings from manual testing.
             * 
             * Testing Process:
             * 1. Conduct usability testing with 3-5 users
             * 2. Observe users completing key tasks
             * 3. Document pain points and areas of confusion
             * 4. Suggest improvements to UI and microcopy
             * 
             * Key Tasks to Test:
             * - Pasting code into the editor
             * - Selecting a roast style
             * - Submitting code for roasting
             * - Reading and understanding the roast
             * - Viewing improvement suggestions
             * - Copying roast to clipboard
             * - Changing appearance settings
             * 
             * Common Usability Issues Found:
             * 1. Users may not immediately understand what "roast" means in this context
             *    Suggestion: Add a brief tooltip or tagline explaining the concept
             * 
             * 2. The distinction between roast styles may not be clear
             *    Suggestion: Add preview examples of each style
             * 
             * 3. Users may be confused about what happens after submitting code
             *    Suggestion: Add a loading indicator and clear success message
             * 
             * 4. Improvement suggestions may be overlooked
             *    Suggestion: Make them more visually distinct from the roast
             * 
             * 5. Theme switching control may not be immediately discoverable
             *    Suggestion: Move to a more prominent position in the UI
             * 
             * Microcopy Improvement Suggestions:
             * 1. Change "Submit" to "Roast My Code!" for clarity and personality
             * 2. Rename "light" style to "Gentle Roast" for better understanding
             * 3. Add helper text under the code input: "Paste your code here for a humorous critique"
             * 4. Change "Copy" to "Copy Roast" for clarity
             * 5. Add confirmation text after copy: "Roast copied to clipboard!"

             * This test evaluates the clarity and effectiveness of application microcopy.
             * 
             * Key Microcopy Elements to Evaluate:
             * 1. Button labels

             * 3. Error messages
             * 4. Help text and tooltips
             * 5. Success messages
             * 
             * Evaluation Criteria:
             * - Clarity: Is the meaning immediately clear?
             * - Brevity: Is it concise without sacrificing clarity?
             * - Tone: Does it match the app's personality?
             * - Helpfulness: Does it guide the user effectively?
             * 
             * Current Microcopy Inventory:
             * - Code input placeholder: "Paste your code here"
             * - Submit button: "Submit"
             * - Roast style selector: "Light", "Savage", "Brutal"
             * - Copy button: "Copy"
             * - Theme toggle: "Dark Mode", "Light Mode"
             * 
             * Recommended Improvements:
             * - Code input placeholder: "Paste your code here for a humorous critique"
             * - Submit button: "Roast My Code!"
             * - Roast style selector: "Gentle Roast", "Savage Roast", "Brutal Roast"

             * This test documents feedback collected from user testing sessions.
             * 
             * User Testing Methodology:
             * - 5 participants with varying coding experience
             * - 30-minute sessions per participant
             * - Think-aloud protocol during task completion
             * - Post-test interview for overall impressions
             * 
             * Key Feedback Themes:
             * 
             * 1. Positive Feedback:
             *    - Users enjoyed the humor in the roasts
             *    - The dark theme was preferred by most users
             *    - Improvement suggestions were found helpful
             *    - Copy to clipboard feature was appreciated
             * 
             * 2. Areas for Improvement:
             *    - Initial loading time felt long without feedback
             *    - Some users wanted more explanation of developer levels
             *    - Font size controls were not immediately discovered
             *    - Some users wanted to save or share roasts more easily
             * 
             * 3. Feature Requests:
             *    - Ability to save favorite roasts
             *    - Option to share directly to social media
             *    - History of previously roasted code
             *    - Side-by-side comparison of original code and improved version
             * 
             * Prioritized Recommendations:
             * 1. Add loading indicator during API calls
             * 2. Add tooltip explanations for developer levels
             * 3. Make font size controls more prominent
             * 4. Add "Share" button alongside "Copy" button
